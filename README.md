# INTAL-C-library
A C library for mathematical operations on huge numbers(integers).

The operations available are:

1) Addition

2) Subtraction

3) Multiplication

4) Division

5) Power

6) Compare

7) Increment

8) Decrement

NOTE: There is no theoretical limit to the size of the integer, but memory limitations of the process (Operating System). If the OS allows, the library should be able to hold the largest prime number known, which is 23,249,425 digits long (as of Feb 2018).
